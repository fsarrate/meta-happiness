# Meta Happiness

An interactive documentary that explores the question: *"How do we find happiness, without the after-life?"*

Meta-Happiness is a Project developed during [Popathon](https://hackdash.org/dashboards/popbcn3) 2016, part of the [InterDocsBarcelona](http://i-docs.org/interdocsbarcelona-2016-23-29-june-interactive-pitch-online-screenings-and-popathon/) Festival. We assembled a team of 6 people who had never worked together before. We agreed on a theme and wrote a script. We gathered content from the web and produced an interactive documentary in less than 12 hours. This is the result of an impromptu collaboration. We enjoyed working on the project which was the product of our spontaneous creativity.

Why did we kill God? We didn't. When we were born, he was already dead. But we found traces of absurd beliefs and ridiculous assumptions that are still, deeply embedded in our society today. These childish, nightmarish fantasies are interfering with our capacity for fulfilment and happiness. We find this particularly annoying. Wherever you are, or wherever you go, we are sure that you will agree with us. And if you don't, well, then, leave your comment and teach us all yet another universal truth ;-)

Thank you!

## How It Works

The viewer is guided through a branching narrative of video pairs. At each step, you watch two perspectives and choose the one that resonates with you. Your choices shape the path through the documentary, leading to a unique ending — culminating in a typewriter-style reflection and a live webcam mirror of yourself.

## Tech

- **fullPage.js** for immersive full-screen sections
- **jQuery** + **Bootstrap 3** for layout and interaction
- **CSS animations** (animate.css) for transitions
- Vanilla JS branching logic driven by a video tree structure
