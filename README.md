# Meta Happiness

An interactive documentary that explores the question: *"How do we find happiness, without the after-life?"*

Assembled a team of 6 strangers, agreed on a theme, wrote a script, gathered web content, and produced an interactive documentary — all in under 12 hours. The result of pure spontaneous creativity.

## How It Works

The viewer is guided through a branching narrative of video pairs. At each step, you watch two perspectives and choose the one that resonates with you. Your choices shape the path through the documentary, leading to a unique ending — culminating in a typewriter-style reflection and a live webcam mirror of yourself.

## Tech

- **fullPage.js** for immersive full-screen sections
- **jQuery** + **Bootstrap 3** for layout and interaction
- **CSS animations** (animate.css) for transitions
- Vanilla JS branching logic driven by a video tree structure

## Structure

```
index.html          Main page
script/main.js      Branching logic and navigation
